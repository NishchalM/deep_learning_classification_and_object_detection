# deep_learning_classification_and_object_detection
These  python codes are a part of the project  "Object Detection and Classification" of our Minor Project. They can be used for reference for any upcoming projects


--> Human_face_dog_breed_classification.py  
This code can do multiple tasks like
1. Differntiate between a human face and a dog image.
2. Create a bounding box around the face detected.
3. Classify dogs into 133 trained breeds.


--> cat_vs_dog.py
The code is for the classification of images of Dog and Cat.
The code was run on Goolge Colab. The dataset can be found here.

Various CNN architectures like 
VGG16,   VGG19,   Inception,   Exception,    Resnet50  are used.


--> dog_breed.py
This code uses pretrained Resnet50 Model to classify breeds of dog.
